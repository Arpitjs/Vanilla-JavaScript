// every object has a prototype
// dates, arrays, functions all of them
// all the methods we can access on that object are stored in its prototype
// __proto__ points to the prototype saying those are the methods available in that object's prototype
// when we add methods to the funcConstructors, its better to do so in its prototype
// that will also help us in prototypal inheritance
